## Build a Use Case

Welcome to the bonus mission of Discord missions!
Submit a PR to our documentation under this section and provide a potential use case that Centrifuge can tap into, using the following categories:

- **Through the lens of an asset originator**
  - Which markets around the world could benefit most from asset financing through centrifuge?
  - Addition of precious metals- Gold, Silver, Platinum. All put up on an AMM agains major currencies like USD, EUR, JPY. FX market AMM pools, can be a massive opportunity. Plus pugging CFG with a FIAT gateway or digital bank can be a game changer. Imagine if an Indian citizen could swap INR with EUR on Centrifuge for European tour he wants to take his family to? No western union, No other intermediary just digital EUR to end-customer. AMM pools get rewarded with $CFG
- **DeFi protocol composability**
  - Centrifuge has started working with MakerDAO and Aave to create instant liquidity for Tinlake pools. What are other great partnership use cases for Centrifuge?
  - a. I'd also like to propose integration with Minterest.finance, they are a money-market protocol on PolkaDOT. Iconomi, prysm group, cardinal cryptography and freelancer - al heavy hitter companies+ ex IBM head of blockchain involved. Suggest you to explore talks with them. Mathew is one of the top 3 engineers on it.

    b. For Centrifuge to become a tier 1 DeFi protocol, Oracles are going to be of key importance. Yes, ChainLink is good, but there is a Tier 1 Oracle Protocol that is being built on PolkaDOT, namely Supra Oracle. Swift feeds, very STRONG security guarantees and a very innovative consensus algorithm. There is SO MUCH more under the hood. Feel free to message me and I will connect you to the team.
    
    c. I'd also suggest do explore talks with Manta Network. Given the stature of your team, I think you very well might know by now, privacy, going forward, will be one of the key components for institutional/enterprise participation. Manta Network is 3 AC backed, and I expect they will become the de-facto privacy chain for PolkaDOT. Really smart team, well-connected and relentless execution. It will bring a lot of value to centrifuge as institutions can privately interact with blockchains for competitive reasons.
    
    d. I'd also vouch for Spectral Finance. They are building credit scores that will leverage on-chain history for credit allocation. I expect it to be a game changer along with teller finance for making DeFi compete with TradFi. For a more deeper understanding, give this a read.

- **Centrifuge Chain (the home for RWA)**
  - Centrifuge Chain is built for RWA origination. Tinlake is a great use case of what can be done with the Centrifuge chain. What are some other cases you can see for the Centrifuge chain?
  - I wonder if somehow we can leverage Tinlake data to build credit reputation? and use it for DeFi related activities on top of DOT ecosystem? e.g giving favourable interest rates to someone repay loans in time? this will help mitigate a lot of risk in case of black-swan evenets.
- **Polkadot**
  - Interoperability is crucial for DeFiâ€™s success. What are some other projects in the Polkadot ecosystem that you think Centrifuge should integrate with?
  - MantraDAO, Phalla and a suit of prpotocols I mentioned in DeFi protocol composability. All of the protocols that are currently launched have a LOT of liquidity. Can be instrumental in initializing money market network effects for the DOT ecosystem.

For any of these categories above ðŸ‘‰ submit a PR to detail how each use case could work. Make sure to think about the entire flow, technology, and size of the potential!
